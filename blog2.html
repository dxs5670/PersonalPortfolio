                            <p>While China has shown unprecedented growth in science & technology, the United States has long been the greatest performer in these sectors. The American free market system has allowed this success by fostering creativity, exploration and discovery. However, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180124113951.htm">the gap is closing</a>. </p>
                            
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>Importance of Competitive Advantage</strong></p>
                            <p>Maintaining this edge is important to the American identity. Therefore, it is no surprise President Trump has made political moves in attempts to secure America’s spot as the leader in technical innovation. </p>
                            <p>Competition with China – and Trump’s moves to stop their epic growth – are nothing new. Over the past four years, there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/economy/trump-china-trade-deal.html">countless claims</a> of cybertheft, infringement of trade secrets, and forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>The Risk Involved</strong></p>
                            <p>There are serious risks that follow these claims. For one, price undercutting has allowed flooding the global market with low priced products, leaving competitors out of business. China has quickly rose to become the world leader in the automobile market using, their purchasing power to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/china-technology-transfer.html">pressure joint ventures</a> with key automobile manufacturers. </p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>America's Response</strong></p>
                            <p>Aggressive action has come in the form of strict trade deals, limiting education visas and even halting foreign investments. More recently, Trump has been looking to tighten exports to <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/us-china-tech-battle-threatens-pandemic-containment-more">prevent China from obtaining</a> advanced U.S. technology “for commercial use and diverting it to military use.” </p>
                            <p>While curbing the risk to national security should be a focus, some of the changes that have been made to policy may ultimately damage U.S. competitiveness. Consider for a moment that 52% of new Silicon Valley companies were started by immigrants. Instead of having graduate students help build the American economy, the U.S. would simply be educating these students to aide in China’s innovation. </p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>Maintaining Competitiveness</strong></p>
                            <p>To simultaneously remain competitive and mitigate risk, the U.S. needs to be more surgical with these regulations while supporting those that are already here. Attempting to derail Chinese success is not only selfish, but also dangerous. Aggressively promoting what the U.S. can offer in research and technology should be a priority. Incentivize building business and accept them with open arms. While the coerced joint ventures on China’s side haven’t necessarily been ethical, they are using their capital to their advantage which is no crime. Even if the short-term costs are large, by not focusing on what we can do in America, we risk so much in the long term.</p>
