                            <p>It is a common social norm to respect privacy. Yet, every day, we willingly share sensitive information about ourselves to people we don’t know. The places we go, our likes and dislikes and the people we interact with are tracked and collected multiple times a day. </p>

                            <p>As more data about us becomes publicly available, <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-anonymized-data-isn-t-so-anonymous-535d2db75a2d">deanonymizing strategies</a> become easier.</p>
                            <p>When considering and combining multiple data sets, the anonymity of sensitive information is always at risk. This becomes evident when considering Netflix’s search for stronger recommendation algorithms. Despite publishing non-personal data on their users, these users were able to be identified based on their recommendations at a 99% success rate. </p>

                            <p>In the United States, some foreign policy reguarding imports and exports have disguised themselves as COVID-19 responses. In all actuality, these policies are targeting China in hopes that they will be unable to catch up to world-leading manufacturing tactics in America.</p>

                            <p>In the case at hand, there are expectations that come with our data being collected. For instance, we expect that our data isn’t being shared or sold. It is fair to expect that collection of our information will not make us worse off than before. If it wasn’t to our benefit, why would we agree to the terms of data collection in the first place?</p>
                            <p>Even if you have “nothing to hide,” in the wrong hands, this knowledge makes you more exploitable.</p>

An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. </p>
                            <p>Buried in vague policy, these same application designers protect themselves from legal action. Consumers are kept in the dark; their data is being old and ther isn't much they can do about it.</p>
