                            <p><strong>Increase in Demand, Decrease in Supply</strong></p>
                            <p>Distancing policies due to the COVID-19 outbreak have driven demand for electronics hardware up. With the need for remote operations for businesses and schools across the world, it would make sense for personal computer shipments to outpace expectations.</p>
                            <p>However, this has not been the case. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-pc-shipments-slide-amid-212250433.html">Computer sales have declined</a> 12% year on year to 51.6 million units sold. After a 5% increase in the fourth quarter of 2019, we are facing the most substantial decline since Q1 of 2015.</p>
                            <p>Major hardware companies are amidst a supply-chain shortage, causing key players in microchip manufacturing, such as Intel, to fall behind on production. Other companies dependent on Intel chips, such as Apple, have been unable to support the surging demand of consumer hardware. </p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>A Delicate Supply-Chain</strong></p>
                            <p>The delicate supply chain that powers the industry is under siege from new foreign and domestic policy. Displacement of working capital has caused several world leaders in semiconductor manufacturing to slow down or stop entirely.</p>
                            <p>Downstream, many entities are struggling due to a lack of semiconductors that are usually predictably available. </p>

                            <p>In the United States, some foreign policy reguarding imports and exports have disguised themselves as COVID-19 responses. In all actuality, these policies are targeting China in hopes that they will be unable to catch up to world-leading manufacturing tactics in America.</p>

                            <p>In attempts to mitigate concerns over semiconductor manufacturing, those involved in the hardware industry are doing what they can to claim such manufacturers as essential. <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/April-6-Multi-Assn-Letter.pdf">One letter</a> to the U.S. Department of Commerce pleads that not only are semiconductors essential to national security, but also to critical infrastructure and relieving public health concerns. </p>
                            <p>“Semiconductors will also play a pivotal role in driving the industries of the future and the economic recovery once the public health emergency is defeated,” the letter argues. The proposal asks that regulatory changes impacting the industry be subject to public comment before becoming effective, ensuring the benefit of both the commerce and the public.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/us-china-tech-battle-threatens-pandemic-containment-more">Another letter</a> to President Trump from an association representing the semiconductor supply chain warned of the possible long-term effects of the rules. </p>
                            <p>[Such rules] “serve as a disincentive for further investments and innovation in the U.S. and lead to the design‐out of U.S. technology and components.”</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>The Risk of Competition</strong></p>
                            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, a long‐time consumer of U.S. chip‐making equipment and the world’s largest producer of commercial chips, which obtains 17 percent of its revenue from sales in China, will look to other countries for their capital equipment needs.</p>
                            <p>This could pose as bad news for the U.S., who is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-vs-china-who-is-winning-the-key-technology-battles-11586548597">quickly losing ground</a> to China in some key technology battles. China has made massive gains when it comes to semiconductor construction. While they have not yet surpassed their American counterparts, it will be interesting to see just how much progress they will be able to make with the present policy.</p>
