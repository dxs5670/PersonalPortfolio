                            <p>In October 2006, Netflix announced <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/03/netflix-cancels-contest/">“The Netflix Prize,”</a> a million-dollar reward to whoever could make their recommendation engine 10% more accurate. To help the mission, they released anonymized data with over 100 million points. A dataset of this magnitude was never in public hands before.</p>
                            <p>It took nearly three years to crack 10%, and just a year later, Netflix was looking for more. A bigger dataset, one that included zip codes, age, gender and ratings was made public. Despite claims that this dataset was anonymized, two researchers were able to deanonymize the data by cross-referencing data from IMDB. A class action lawsuit was filed promptly, leaving Netflix to compensate each of their subscribers.</p>

                            <p>If Netflix had to pay out, how can other companies sell our data to advertisers and hedge funds without ramifications? Even more startling is how available this “anonymous” data has become today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html">The New York Times</a> was able to look over a single dataset, tracking people through their daily routines and correctly identifying them. While “the interest is in patterns,” the concept is no different than being stalked.</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>How is this Legal?</strong></p>
                            <p>Data is monitored and recorded legally through privacy policy. While vague and complicated, agreeing to these policies gives companies free reign over your data. If you ever thought your favorite applications were truly free, think again.</p>
                            <p>Even if you do happen to read the privacy policy, there is no way to tell what your data is being used for or who it is being handed off to. Many applications that collect data mislead users into accepting by only telling the benefits of accepting. Even industry insiders admit their users don’t understand what they’re agreeing to.</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>Can We Control Our Data Transmissions?</strong></p>
                            <p>Since there are no laws preventing these deceptive business practices, it is difficult to prevent our data from being collected. However, we have the ability to limit some data, like our location, from being collected in our smartphone’s settings. Dually, spread awareness. Tell your family and friends to check their phones. You can give location access to just the people you trust.</p>
                            <p>Limiting your location services does not make you anonymous. There are many apps that require you to accept these terms, binding you into data collection, else they render you unable to use their services. There are some ways around this.</p>
                            <p>You can disguise your connection with a Virtual Private Network (VPN), making your connection appear like it is somewhere else. While these typically aren’t free services, they do encrypt your data and transmit them to ports across the globe. Your entry and exit points are still predictable, meaning you aren’t untraceable. On the bright side, the added layer of security will undoubtedly throw off all but the most advanced trackers.</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12"><p><strong>Is that it?</strong></p>
                            <p>There is no solution that promises total security besides disconnecting from the web entirely. If you want a more permanent solution, continue to spread awareness and seek political support. Until we catch the legal system up to the internet, we will always be at risk when online.</p>
